# Market Analysis in Forex Stock Market using Multi-CNN Model

This repository contains the implementation and research findings of a novel approach for market analysis in the Forex stock market. The study explores various econometric models, moving averages, technical indicators, and machine learning techniques commonly used for predicting stock market trends. The primary focus of this research is the introduction of a new model known as the **Multi-CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** model, which incorporates domain knowledge specific to Forex trading.

## Abstract

This paper presents an innovative method for market analysis in the Forex stock market by introducing the **Multi-CNN model**, a deep learning approach that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and domain-specific knowledge of Forex trading. The model's performance is evaluated using EURUSD data spanning from January 2015 to December 2020. The dataset is meticulously preprocessed, normalized, and partitioned into distinct training, validation, and testing sets.

Benchmarked against established models including Single-LSTM, Single-GRU, and Single-CNN, the proposed Multi-CNN model demonstrates a notable enhancement in stock market trend prediction. This research provides compelling insights into the application of deep learning techniques for accurate forecasting of stock market trends. Notably, the advantages of integrating CNNs and leveraging multiple time frames are underscored, setting the Multi-CNN model apart from conventional models such as simple CNN, LSTM, and other recurrent neural network-based models.

## Model Description

### Suggested Model Architecture

To enhance the accuracy of EURUSD predictions, this academic paper introduces innovative models that exploit multiple time frames of EURUSD data during the training process. The three distinct time frames employed in the proposed model are carefully selected: 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1 hour. Incorporating these diverse time frames allows the model to capture intricate and intricate hidden patterns inherent in sequential data, particularly in the context of time series analysis.

#### Network Composition

Each model in this study is composed of three separate neural networks, each utilizing a pair of convolutional neural network (CNN) layers. The first CNN layer is designed with 256 neurons, enabling it to extract high-level features from the input data. The subsequent layer, comprising 128 neurons, further refines the extracted features, effectively capturing the underlying patterns. This hierarchical architecture facilitates the learning of intricate representations that are crucial for accurate predictions.

Following the convolutional layers, a fully connected layer with four neurons is employed in each neural network. This layer is responsible for predicting the values associated with open, high, low, and close prices for each specific time frame. By producing predictions at multiple levels, the model can effectively capture and leverage the inherent characteristics of each time frame, leading to more robust predictions.

#### Fusion of Information

To consolidate the predicted values obtained from the different time frames and combine the CNNs, a concatenation layer is employed, enabling the fusion of information across the temporal spectrum. Subsequently, a fully connected layer is utilized to predict the output value for the target timeframe. This design architecture ensures the comprehensive integration of information from diverse time frames, facilitating a holistic understanding of the data and enhancing the modelâ€™s predictive performance.

Furthermore, Figure 3 visually presents the architecture of the Multi-CNN model, which has demonstrated superior performance in terms of loss reduction when compared to alternative models.
